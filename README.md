# AI-Driven-Analysis-of-Employee-Engagement-Survey-Feedback

Employee engagement surveys often include open-ended comments that provide rich, qualitative insights into organizational culture, leadership, and employee sentiment. However, analyzing these unstructured responses at scale remains a challenge for most organizations. This project presents an AI-powered Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline designed to automatically process, categorize, and visualize employee feedback from engagement surveys. The system supports four core capabilities: classification of comments into predefined organizational themes such as Leadership, Compensation, and Communication, sentiment analysis to label feedback as positive, neutral, or negative, unsupervised discovery of emerging topics not captured by predefined themes using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and interactive visualization through a custom Streamlit dashboard. The pipeline employs a modular architecture beginning with a comprehensive preprocessing step that cleans and normalizes noisy, emoji-laden, and inconsistent text. Supervised learning is implemented using fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer models for both sentiment and theme classification. The sentiment classifier achieved an accuracy of 94.19%, while the theme classifier reached 87.42% accuracy, based on a dataset of 3,260 labeled employee comments. Additionally, an LDA model is used to uncover hidden themes in unlabeled data, with coherence and perplexity metrics ensuring topic interpretability and quality. The final output is presented in a Streamlit-based dashboard that enables users to filter feedback by sentiment and theme, explore word clouds, visualize topic clusters, and analyze trends over time. By automating the end-to-end analysis of open-ended survey responses, this solution offers organizations a scalable, data-driven method to amplify employee voice and guide strategic HR decisions. The pipeline closes the loop between qualitative employee feedback and actionable insights, enabling leaders to proactively respond to workforce concerns.
